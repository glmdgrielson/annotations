  <TEXT>The final phase of this fight is essentially a team effort between you and Shield Knight. You&#39;ll need to leap off her once she gives you the opportunity, which in turn, gives you enough height to hit the Enchantress in the head. After you hit her a few times, the Enchantress will generally move quickly to the other side of the screen to prevent you from getting any extra hits (although you can actually get around this slightly by using the Propeller Dagger).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Beyond that, the developers are also planning on adding even more content to the game as well. Some of these additional modes include new challenge missions, a gender-swap mode, and story modes for three of the boss characters (King Knight, Specter Knight, and Plague Knight).

  <TEXT>Despite the fact that I hated my old playthrough of that game, and that this update is essentially giving me a chance to redo it, I think I&#39;ll have to pass on it for now. Even with some of the aforementioned updates, there&#39;s very little incentive for me to go through what I generally consider to be an average game in most aspects. Coupling in with the fact that everyone has pretty much pointed out what&#39;s right or wrong with that game by now, there&#39;s really not a whole lot I can add. I generally don&#39;t let that kind of thing stop me from doing a playthrough - that is, if I find the game fun (as evidence with this game). Unlimited however, just isn&#39;t all that fun for me by comparison.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>While I could take a break and wait out the release time for that game (along with a few other ones), there&#39;s actually another game that came out recently to potentially fill this gap: A rom-hack by the name of &quot;Mega Man 4: Burst Chaser X Air Sliding.&quot; Based on that title alone, you can probably already guess the main gist of this hack. It also happens to be made by Tsukikuro, the same guy who made the Rockman Claw series.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>The fight with the Enchantress is a bit different than some of the other main bosses so far. Aside from constantly floating around and being somewhat difficult to hit, her attacks can also interact with the ground (which is completely destructible from both her attacks and your own). She also tends to float towards the bottom of the screen, where she can use a few homing attacks (which thankfully reform blocks when it passes through empty spaces). Beyond that, she can also try to dive bomb you with her best Storm Eagle impression.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>So then, now that this game is completed, what&#39;s next? For now, I was planning on getting back to my roots with Mega Man again, especially since there&#39;s quite a few options on-hand as well. For one, there&#39;s the obvious choice of Unlimited, which got a bit of an update to Ver 1.2.0 a little while ago. Aside from toggling with some stage layouts and somehow making Rainbow Man&#39;s theme even blander, the update also added in a special stage and an endless attack mode.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>So then, what&#39;s left to be said about this game? Putting aside any accusations of &quot;nostalgia baiting&quot; with its overall style, I feel this game is easily one of the better platformers released in a long time. The presentation, mechanics, music, and almost everything in this game work amazingly well. On top of that, the difficulty level is just right, and the game actually doesn&#39;t penalize you too much if you die (as a quick reminder, since I didn&#39;t show this off during this run - there isn&#39;t a life system in this game at all. Instead you lose a bit of money every time you die, which you can then collect once you reach that spot again).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Finally, it&#39;s time for the last level of the game. The final stage itself is actually quite short, only consisting of a few rooms that lead up to the Enchantress herself. Aside from introducing one final gimmick in the form of suddenly appearing blocks, there&#39;s also a secret room in this level that will not only give you a bunch of diamonds, but also the last few music sheets in the game (along with a full health pick-up and a Troupple Fish).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Normally this is where I would chime in about my overall thoughts on the game and what I have planned next, if anything. However, there&#39;s actually a neat little sequence before the credits here. If you haven&#39;t seen it before, I&#39;d suggest watching it.

  <TEXT>This game is about $15 on Steam at the moment. If you have the chance to buy it, or pick up a physical copy in the form of the 3DS or Wii U versions, I&#39;d definitely recommend giving it a go. You won&#39;t be disappointed in the slightest. Also, despite the fact that I completed this game in about 3 hours (although it&#39;s apparently possible to do it in less then 1), there&#39;s quite a bit of replayability value with this as well. There&#39;s a New Game Plus mode that starts you off at the beginning, but with everything from your current save. Most enemies and bosses will also deal more damage in this mode as well.</TEXT>
