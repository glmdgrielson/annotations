  <TEXT>Atetemino is just as annoying as he was in the original game. The positioning for where you need to aim the Mega Ball is slightly different for this version, but you can generally hit him with the same tactics. Mercifully, you can also get multiple hits on him per cycle as well (you can also use Astro Crush while he&#39;s at low health, but I wanted to save it for the boss in the next level).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Sword Man is actually a bit tougher than he was in the original, mostly due to the various adjustments to his moves. His version of the Flame Sword now launches out several fireballs across the room, rather than across the ground. His Fire Column also has a pulling effect, where it reels you in along with blocking out projectiles. Finally, his Fire Slash now has a new variation where he goes across the floor, forcing you to jump rather than slide.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>This is the main reason as to why I wanted the Homing Sniper before coming here. The bats in this section are just as annoying as the big tellies in Frost Man&#39;s stage, where they can easily knock you off at the last moment into instant-death. It also doesn&#39;t help that you need to be fast in this section, as there&#39;s another constant threat of instant-death following you.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Before I move on to the hell-hole that is Dr. Wily&#39;s castle, I wanted to at least get two more items from the shop: The Energy Balancer, and the Exchanger (health pick-ups will refill weapons if your life is full). Given the amount of larger bolts has been cut down significantly in this game, I&#39;ll spare you the process of me grinding for smaller ones.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Now then, I think it&#39;s time to address something: I don&#39;t hate Mega Man 8 as much as some other people do. In fact, I actually enjoy a few of the mechanics from the original (especially in how certain weapons interact with the environment, along with reactions from the bosses). With that being said however, if there&#39;s one thing that ever causes me ire above all else with this game, it&#39;s Wily 1.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>The trials at the beginning of Sword Man&#39;s stage have all been modified in some way. The ones involving Tornado Hold and Flash Bomb have been combined into one room, though they&#39;re not necessary to use anymore. In fact, it&#39;s possible to get through all of them without certain weapons (though I couldn&#39;t imagine doing so for the Thunder Claw and Ice Wave rooms).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>The Flame Sword is still pretty good, but not overly helpful in most situations. It&#39;s capable of killing off most enemies with one use, provided you get them in-contact with the full range of its multiple hits. This tends to work out better with semi-stationary enemies (such as Sniper Joes and the Gori-Three variations).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>I&#39;m going to be brutally honest here: MM8&#39;s first Wily stage is my personal pick as one of the worst stages in the entire classic series (I would have to redact that if I were to include the X series, but it would still be pretty close to the top of my personal hate list). The only good thing to come out of this stage is the music. Everything else with this level is a gigantic train-wreck.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Sadly, the second area leading to the city section at night was completely cut out. On one hand, it makes the stage much shorter (and eliminates the second snowboarding segment all-together).
