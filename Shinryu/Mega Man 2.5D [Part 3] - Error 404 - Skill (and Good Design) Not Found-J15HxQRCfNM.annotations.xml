  <TEXT>Seriously...what the actual hell is this? I refuse to believe that someone looked at this jump and said &quot;Yes, this is not going to be frustrating in the slightest.&quot; There&#39;s a very good reason single-tile conveyors and low, spiked ceilings don&#39;t mix well (not to mention the underwater physics at play here, too).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>On that note however, both of those elements fall short as well. The 2.5D, while visually neat, rarely ever makes a difference besides shifting the screen slightly. The only place where it actually kinda matters is the Blue Devil fight (which isn&#39;t even that good to begin with). The co-op meanwhile is a neat idea. In fact, this is one of the few MM titles I can think of to include this feature somewhat effectively. However, it also gets bogged down by the fact that it&#39;s local only (that, and from what I&#39;ve seen, if one player dies then both get sent back to the last checkpoint).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Also, just to note: Laser Trident seems to be the Blue Devil&#39;s actual weakness, but the Shadow Blade is ultimately more effective since you can get more hits in on him with it. From what I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s actually possible to beat him as early as his 2nd cycle (I&#39;m just terrible at implementing speedrun strategies, though).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>And it&#39;s possible to skip one of those paths entirely by using Rush Jet (trust me, you&#39;re not missing out on much).

  <TEXT>On one hand, I really would like to re-visit the idea of doing something with Dark Souls 3. Who knows? Maybe the Ringed City DLC will be better for playthrough material than Ashes of Ariandel was.

  <TEXT>With that being said, the Wily fortress does do one thing right: (Almost) any time there&#39;s an instance of forced weapon usage, there&#39;s usually a Telly spawner to make sure you don&#39;t run out of ammo. Granted, I&#39;d rather it be possible go through it buster only, but at the very least it&#39;s not possible to get stuck. The only exceptions to this are the first few instances of Rush Coil/Jet usage, which are basically just there to teach you how they work.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>I don&#39;t think I have an excuse for this upcoming death. With that being said, I feel justified in ranting about the section that comes immediately afterwards: This one jump is single-handedly one of my most hated platforming sections of any fan-game I can recall in recent memory (in the grand scheme of things, it&#39;s certainly high up there at least). The only redeeming factor is that the checkpoint is relatively close. Still, that doesn&#39;t excuse the asinine layout of the last two jumps to the ladder.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>The Mega Man Killers are more or less the same as their usual counterparts. The only exception to this is Punk, who has very bad telegraphing on his new motions (instead of just flying high or low, he now has a &quot;middle&quot; dash that can easily catch you off-guard if you dodge the wrong way). Fighting all three in a row can be a bit taxing unless you&#39;re willing to exploit their weaknesses (or use E-Tanks).

  <TEXT>That wasn&#39;t sloppy editing, by the way. You can actually skip the fortress map sequences in this game (a good feature, to be honest). Now however, it&#39;s time for Wily 2. As implied before, this is where the game starts to make its love for instant death more prominent. I pretty much guarantee that most of your deaths in this stage (and the next one) are going to be from either pits or spikes. Come to think of it, that&#39;s generally all I ever see people die to in this game. Rarely is it ever from the actual enemies.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>After all of that, we finally come to the one part of this entire game where the 2.5D element serves an actual purpose. The Blue Devil is interesting on paper, but sadly ends up being tedious and more than a little ineffective in execution. It plays out like a typical devil fight at first, but then it flips perspective to reveal a set of spikes on both sides of the arena. The problem however, is that you don&#39;t need to go anywhere near these spikes to deal damage or efficiently avoid the oncoming devil pieces (the Wave Man steam puffs in-between each phase also don&#39;t do anything, seeing as they can be avoided by just standing in the center).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Wily 3 plays out a bit differently than the other fortress stages. Here, your goal is to destroy 6 power generators to unlock the gates leading to the boss room. The level itself is somewhat open-ended, since it&#39;s mainly composed of branching paths that lead to those generators. It&#39;s a neat idea to be sure, but sadly falls short due to all the paths playing out roughly the same way (they all generally involve death pits, conveyor belts, and hammers. A few of them involve yoku blocks, but that&#39;s about it as far as their variety goes).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Time for the final part of the game, and it&#39;s a vertical auto-scroller with ladders and falling platforms. Not the worst set-up in the world, but it does pull one last cheap shot: There&#39;s one section here with a floor made up entirely of falling platforms with a jump to a ladder at the end. This would be fine if not for the fact that the screen needs to rotate as you&#39;re doing this part. Naturally you&#39;d want to wait for the screen to catch up so you can see what you&#39;re doing, but in this case, you can&#39;t do that since the floor is going to crumble away if you stand around for too long.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>For the Wily Machine, we have...Gamma&#39;s skeleton, I guess? Whatever the case, this thing is pretty standard: Jump on its hands when you get the chance to (or just use Rush Coil), then fire away at the eyes. The second phase plays out roughly the same way, too. Although there&#39;s a wind effect that tries to push you off the hands if you stay on them for too long, it&#39;s easy enough to move against it and keep getting in hits.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Not gonna lie: I&#39;m kinda glad that&#39;s over with. This game is, to put it bluntly, really disappointing. Almost nothing about this seems like it should have taken roughly 8 years to make. Coding all the gimmicks/bosses/etc and making an engine from scratch is understandable as far as time consumption goes...but design wise, you could crank out similar (and superior) stages in Blyka&#39;s engine or the Mega Engine far quicker. Hell, they have about roughly the same effect, seeing as this game&#39;s only major draws are its visuals and co-op.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Speaking of Rush, the fortress is the only place where you&#39;re allowed to use him. If you go back to the stage select (via getting a game over) and want to use Rush to get...let&#39;s say, some of the Bond Man letters (specifically the horrible one in Tornado Man&#39;s stage), the game actively takes him away from you while you&#39;re in the RM stages. Aside from making no sense, it severely limits your options for collecting any of the extra stuff.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Yeah, I got no excuse for this one either. This is also a good time to point out that any time you die in this stage, you get sent back to the first room. It&#39;s not exactly the worst thing ever due to how the stage/boss is set up, but backtracking is inevitably going to become an issue if you end up dying a whole lot while trying to get to the generators.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Mecha Dragon is a bit more interesting this time around. The initial chase sequence is extended with some more platforming and ladder climbing. The actual fight itself...surprisingly enough, doesn&#39;t take place over a few one-tile blocks. While it&#39;s nice to have some basic ground to stand on while fighting the Dragon for a change, I unfortunately have to take points right back due to its charge attack (that can only be avoided by hanging off the ladders - which incidentally, if you get hit by his tail while on them, spells instant death in the pit below). At the very least, this is a step in the right direction as far as Mecha Dragon fights go.</TEXT>
