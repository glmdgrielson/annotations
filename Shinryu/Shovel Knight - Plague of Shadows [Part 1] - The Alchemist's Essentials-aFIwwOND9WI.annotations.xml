  <TEXT>As a final point of advice here: Throw a bomb directly into the opening of Oolong&#39;s head. This will actually produce one of the more well-hidden music sheets in the game.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>All this kind of left me without much to do. Thankfully, a long-awaited update to an already amazing game gave me the answer. Shovel Knight: Plague of Shadows is an update which includes Plague Knight as a playable character, along with a new challenge mode for both him and Shovel Knight. Right from the start, I knew I was going to enjoy this thanks to how they handled Plague Knight&#39;s campaign. Unlike a few other games that include extra characters as unlockables or updated content, Plague Knight actually gets his own story instead of being there just for the sake of being there.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>As for Plague Knight himself, his play-style is vastly different from Shovel Knight&#39;s in pretty much every way imaginable. His main method of attacking is by tossing bombs. It&#39;s important to note that the angle of your throw also changes depending on what you do: If you&#39;re standing on the ground, Plague Knight will throw his bombs forward. If you&#39;re in the air, he&#39;ll throw them downwards. The latter also causes him to pause in mid-air every time you throw a bomb.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Percy is....well, he&#39;s Percy. While I could just leave it at that, he actually does have a purpose: He acts similar to the Bard, where you can trade in music sheets for money. While he doesn&#39;t play any music, he will throw some of the sheets over to Oolong (the creature to the left). Oolong then acts as the Bard in this case, though his variety of songs is limited by comparison (the main reason for this is that most of his songs are exclusive to Plague Knight&#39;s campaign).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>For this playthrough, I&#39;ll basically be doing the same requirements as my initial one with Shovel Knight: Get through the whole game with zero deaths, and collect 100% of all items. In Plague Knight&#39;s case, the latter half mainly involves collecting Cipher Coins, which there are several of in each stage (usually 30 or so for the main levels).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Plague Knight also has one more trait you&#39;ll need to watch out for: His knock-back is much stronger than Shovel Knight&#39;s. If you&#39;re not careful, you can end up getting tossed back into bottomless pits more often than you&#39;d like to admit. Fortunately, you save yourself with some quick uses of the bomb burst, double jump, or even the bomb toss (not to mention you&#39;ll obtain more potentially life saving abilities later on).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Plague Knight actually doesn&#39;t get as many max health upgrades as Shovel Knight does. To compensate for this, he can obtain Health Tonics, which both heal him and increase his max health (up until you die, in which case, the effects wear off and you&#39;ll have to increase your health again by finding more tonics).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>It feels like it&#39;s been a while. To be honest, I was stressing out a bit over what to play next on this channel. I eventually had it boiled down to a few options such as Mega Man X3 or possibly Five Nights at Candy&#39;s. I held off on the former however after taking a look at a playable Zero mod for the game (which is still being updated, so I wanted to wait for its completion). As for the latter, I figured since October is rapidly approaching, I&#39;d save it for some form of pre-Halloween special (my usual method for celebrating Halloween on this channel will still go on, for those of you interested and/or possibly concerned).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>The Magicist will sell you Health Tonics and Magic Upgrades. The latter of these is a permanent boost of your ability to use Arcana (Plague Knight&#39;s equivalent to Shovel Knight&#39;s relics). You don&#39;t get as many magic upgrades as Shovel Knight would, but then again, Plague Knight can make the most out of these even with a smaller pool of magic (that, and there&#39;s the fact that his magic meter auto-refills over time as well).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Since I wanted to save the main stages for the next few videos, the rest of this is mainly going through what the Potionarium has to offer. Starting off, Mona can sell you different cases, powder, and fuses for your bombs. Each one has a different effect, and you can mix up these different pieces of equipment to create several unique explosives. She can also sell you different types of burst effects, along with the &quot;Research&quot; option which adds more to her inventory (doing so requires a certain amount of Cipher Coins, however).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>There&#39;s a few things to keep in mind about the Bomb Burst: If you charge up a burst and use it while stationary, it&#39;ll just propel Plague Knight straight up. Using it while moving will cause him to lunge forward in whatever direction he&#39;s facing. The momentum you gain from the lunge means you won&#39;t be able to change directions as easily, though you can use your double jump to shift or even halt your movement. As another option though, you can use the double jump to further propel yourself forwards during the lunge (but you won&#39;t be able to change directions in mid-air as a result of this).</TEXT>
