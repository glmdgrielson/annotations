  <TEXT>Let&#39;s not mince words here: This version of Bass.EXE doesn&#39;t deserve to be fought fairly in any regards. He has the standard Life Aura that blocks out anything that deals less than 100 damage. That in itself wouldn&#39;t be so bad...if the aura didn&#39;t regenerate after every time you hit him. Seriously, just spam the Z-Cannon PA, Tree-Bomb 3, or Proto Man&#39;s Navi chip on him. Really, it&#39;s not worth trying to use anything else.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Alright, last transition effect for the segment, I swear. Anyways, after getting every Navi chip in the game, you should get an email from Mayl. This signals that you can now reach the hidden boss in Den Area 3, located just beyond the teleporter to Global Area 1. You absolutely need the Double Jump chip to make it to this section, along with chips that deal at least 100 damage or more (for reasons you&#39;re about to see).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>By comparison, Pharaoh Man&#39;s chips are pretty &quot;meh.&quot; His ability chip is the Poison Pharaoh, which is nowhere near as good as it was in the original series (on top of having a lengthy start-up time, its damaging process is too slow to be useful). His Navi chip is kind of neat, but it deals such little damage that it&#39;s only useful for the occasional horde of minor enemies. Considering the game puts a very high priority on you using chips that deal over 100 damage by this point, there&#39;s little to no reason to ever use it.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Before moving on to the final stage of the game, there&#39;s a few more things we can get done first. One of these is collecting all the Navi chips, which then allows access to the secret boss (Note: This also includes Zero&#39;s Navi chip, so if you didn&#39;t collect the data in Global Area 3, you&#39;ve pretty much locked yourself out of an extra battle chip and boss fight).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Finally, after getting every Navi chip and beating Bass, we&#39;re presented with our reward......aaaaaaand it&#39;s pretty damn underwhelming. Bass&#39; Navi chip is basically a multi-hitting screen clearing attack. Let&#39;s all say it together now: Multi-hitting chips suck against bosses in this game. It also really doesn&#39;t help that it only deals 60 damage per hit, making it downright useless for the final area (where the enemies happen to have their own Life Auras as well).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>ProtoMan.EXE is quite possibly the toughest boss in the entire game, so much in fact that I honestly haven&#39;t been able to find a decent way to fight him; He&#39;s fast, hits hard, and actually has two different counter moves. The main one I want to draw attention to is his shield, which sends out a shockwave if you hit it. This shield can be used to counter pretty much any attack you throw at him...including Navi chips (you know, those things that stop everything? He&#39;s not beyond pulling a Jotaro by countering you when time is frozen).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>As hinted at before, Proto Man&#39;s Navi chip is incredibly good. It locks onto the single closest enemy and deals very high damage (160, to be exact). If you&#39;re ever going to use at least one Navi chip through-out this entire game, definitely make it this one. His ability chip meanwhile...isn&#39;t as useful, sadly. The Var-Sword, while incredibly broken in the original series, falls short in this setting. It essentially produces a random sword slash every time you use it, turning it into more a gamble-weapon than anything.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Taking a bit of a detour before getting the last Navi chip, let&#39;s pay a visit to that special enemy in Pharaoh Man&#39;s stage. As mentioned in the last video, this version of the Mole shows up at random. Much like the normal version, it only takes 1 point of damage from attacks. That might not seem so bad, at least until you realize this thing has a whopping 200 HP. For the sake of convenience, I&#39;ll skip past the 6 or so minutes it took to kill it.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>We&#39;re not quite done with Proto Man yet, though. Beating him once opens his re-fight and a chance to get his Navi chip, which I seriously recommend you do (even if you&#39;re not aiming to fight the hidden boss). If push comes to shove, the quickest way you can beat him is by abusing the Pop-Up chip and/or the Z-Cannon Program Advance. Invincibility might be a cheap way to get through this fight, but on the other hand, the only thing you&#39;re bound to get out of fighting him normally is a headache.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Shadow Man&#39;s chips are pretty decent all around. His ability chip is the Muramasa; Which, as per Battle Network tradition, outputs more damage the lower your health is. His Navi chip tosses 3 shurikens directly at whatever enemy happens to be close by. The shurikens deal 90 damage each, which is fine for strong singular enemies, but not as good against bosses (echoing almost every other Navi chip at this point).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Despite being incredibly boring, this process is still worth going through, as beating this version of the Mole rewards you with the most broken battle chip in the entire game: The Pop-Up chip makes you completely invincible for a pretty lengthy amount of time. The only drawback is that you can be hit while you use attacks, but your vulnerable state doesn&#39;t really last that long, nor does your invincibility wear off if you happen to get hit.</TEXT>
