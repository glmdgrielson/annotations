  <TEXT>Heart Man (Mr. Heart from Fist of the North Star) is another good starting boss. He&#39;s quite slow with his attacks, and he&#39;s not too difficult to avoid. Then again, that&#39;s not to say there aren&#39;t a few things to keep in mind about him; For one, he&#39;s actually invincible during his rolling attacks. He also happens to sport a projectile move, where the projectiles themselves can easily blend in with the background if you&#39;re not paying close attention.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Speaking of which, the options menu has gotten a few new helpful changes as well. Aside from being able to select which weapons you start with, along with up to 9 E-Tanks, you can also select any of the later stages to start on as well (including the final boss). This is amazingly useful for picking up progress, especially compared to the first game (where the furthest you could continue from was the first fortress boss).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Vegeta here isn&#39;t quite as difficult as Aya, but he still manages to be troublesome without his weakness. Aside from firing off several projectiles, he also possesses an array of kicks that are rather difficult to telegraph.

  <TEXT>Skullo Man (Skullomania from Street Fighter EX) is simple enough to deal with. He has a variety of different lunging motions, most of which involve either leaping up into the air or sliding, but they&#39;re generally much easier to telegraph than Vegeta&#39;s kicks. The only really dangerous move he has is a spinning motion that sucks you towards him. Unless he has you in a corner however, you can easily get away from it by sliding.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>While this is going on though, I may as well go over some of the changes in comparison to the first one. Aside from the aforementioned weapon set being improved, Mega Man himself can now slide (essentially giving this game MM3 controls). While it&#39;s not an overly necessary function, it helps out tremendously with the boss battles now.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Sumou Woman (Hinako Shijou from the King of Fighters) is another easy boss to deal with, just so long as you&#39;re observing her moves closely.

This particular attack is the one you need to watch out for, since firing at it will actually bounce your attacks back at you.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Death Crimson is sadly one of the more lack-luster weapons in this game. It sends out a target that you control with the arrows, while pressing the fire button again causes an explosion over wherever it happens to be. While it has large ammo reserves and deals decently strong damage, the problem comes in the fact that you can&#39;t move Mega Man while using this weapon. You can cancel out of it by jumping or sliding, but it tends to be very finicky at times.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Of course I wouldn&#39;t start with anyone but Dio Brando. Surprisingly enough, he&#39;s actually not too difficult to deal with so long as you position yourself well.

  <TEXT>The World is easily the best (and the most exploitable) weapon in this game.

  <TEXT>Meat Shot is more or less a better version of Kung-Fu Board from the first game. It fires out the same way, but it&#39;s much bigger and faster this time around. Granted, it still doesn&#39;t have too many uses in a setting like this, but it&#39;s at least a step in the right direction.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Honestly, I was kind of expecting Galick Gun to be Vegeta&#39;s weapon, but Big-Bang Attack works too. Referring back to the improved weapon comparison, this is essentially a far superior version of Trillion Flare. It deals a strong amount of damage, it has a much higher ammo count, and it even takes less time to fully charge up.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Hustler Man (Nine-Ball from Armored Core) is probably the most annoying of the 8 main bosses. The problem with this fight mostly stems from a combination of his weakness and his attack patterns. Since Death Crimson forces you to stand completely still, you&#39;ll most likely be taking quite a bit of unnecessary punishment from his attacks in the mean-time. That&#39;s not to mention that a good portion of his moves are quite fast as well.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Tengu Woman (Aya Shameimaru from Touhou) is one of the more difficult bosses of the main 8. She focuses on projectiles, mostly in the form of wind or crows, the latter of which mostly serves as a distraction. One of these is actually a tornado (not seen in this video) which launches you up to the ceiling, dealing rather insane damage in the process.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Wind Chakram is pretty decent for the most part. It fires out and sticks to one spot for a few seconds, and then acts a bit like a boomerang as it goes back. It&#39;s probably best utilized by setting it up in spots where a boss is either about to jump to, or on a path where they&#39;re going to converge with it.</TEXT>
