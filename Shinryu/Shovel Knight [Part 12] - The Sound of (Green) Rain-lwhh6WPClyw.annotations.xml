  <TEXT>Thanks to the Enchantress, the the final fight with the Black Knight is far more difficult when compared to the previous two. Aside from retaining and putting a few new twists on his original moves, he also has a whole slew of new attacks. Among these include a new gliding move that replaces his back-dash, which not only lasts longer, but also makes him completely invincible. He can also fly, rain down a higher amount of projectiles, and is now smart enough to bounce back any of his own projectiles you attempt to reflect at him.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>The Liquid Samurai is the final &quot;Guest Director&quot; enemy of the game, and is the only one of these specially implemented foes that isn&#39;t a boss. Despite this, they actually prove themselves to be one of the more difficult enemy types of the game. Aside from being fast, they also come in two different varieties (the red versions rush at you with swords, while the green ones will jump around and fire at you from a distance).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>With nearly everything else in the game taken care of, it&#39;s finally time to take on the last few stages. To be honest, I actually don&#39;t have too much to say about the Tower of Fate levels. A good portion of them are gauntlets mostly composed of mechanics from previous stages (with a few new ones here and there).</TEXT>
