  <TEXT>Flash Man is the only playable RM that I have any major issues with. The premise on his gameplay is fine: He has a spread-shot buster and a charge-up ability that activates the Flash Stopper (in which you can fire while time is frozen, thankfully). The problem however, is mainly with his buster. The shots from it spread in three different angles at complete random, which makes hitting anything at mid to long range more hectic than it needs to be.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>One other interesting quirk about the Bubble Lead that works both on land and in water is that it can actually capture certain projectiles and bounce them back. This also deals extra damage to enemies in the process. Although it doesn&#39;t really come into play all that often, it&#39;s still a neat mechanic that helps with Bubble Man&#39;s usual restrictions. There&#39;s also something else it can do, but we won&#39;t be seeing it until the next stage.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Heheh, I always wanted to see one of those stupid things die. On that note however, Bubble Man isn&#39;t a requirement for this stage (nor are any of the RM&#39;s for other levels, unless you&#39;re going after the secret items), but he definitely makes getting by those things easier. This is especially considering the Electric Spines and other enemies can destroy sections of the Leaf Shield.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>That in turn, leads me to Wood Man&#39;s main flaw: Much like Crash Man, he can only have one of his trademark weapon on-screen at the same time. As such, it really hurts if you either miss your mark or fail to take down an enemy in time with him.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Just to note again (for those of you that didn&#39;t go back and watch the previous video, which now has annotations): There&#39;s a rather long pause before you warp out of a level after beating a boss. For the sake of convenience, I edited these parts to be shorter (this explains why the water level goes down so quickly here).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Gemini Man&#39;s battle has the most modifications out of the 8 main bosses (though this is obviously on account of Bubble Man&#39;s traits). He still summons a clone during the battle, but he now only sticks to one spot. Given you can only reach him once you fill the room up with water (and combined with Bubble Lead&#39;s bullet canceling abilities), he&#39;s far easier here compared to his original version.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Wood Man falls somewhere in the same category as Bubble Man, but he does have some helpful traits. Although he moves relatively slow and has the lowest jump in the game, his Leaf Shield is thankfully far superior the one from MM2. It can now be fired in 4 directions with the press of a button, rather than simply going off whenever you move. It works well in stopping projectiles, and for one of the new gimmicks, it can also block out turrets and other hazards found in this stage.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Bubble Man is one of the more situational characters in the game. On land, he&#39;s very slow and has a somewhat low jump. His Bubble Lead also travels along the ground similar to Mega Man&#39;s own version. Naturally, his true strengths come out when he&#39;s in the water: His speed is greatly increased, and his Bubble Lead can bounce around like his original version.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>On yet another side-note, I&#39;ve personally been trying to complete every stage by using the initial Robot Masters for them as much as possible. In Flash Man&#39;s case however, I had to make a few exceptions. Honestly, if you could control the angle of the shots by holding up or down while firing, it would make it far more practical. As it stands however, trying to hit anything with his buster from a decent distance is almost luck-based more than anything.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Spark Man&#39;s only change is that his room now has a leveled out floor, along with the addition of two lift-platforms on both sides. While I found this to be a bit odd at first, I can now see the reasoning behind it: Wood Man&#39;s jump is so low that you likely wouldn&#39;t be able to get over Spark Man&#39;s larger projectile without the lifts.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Top Man&#39;s pattern is virtually the same as it was before, only now his tops are fired out in a row that travels forward instead of homing in on you. This mostly ties in with his longer wind-up time during his spinning move, which gives you a chance to use the Time Stopper and punish him while he&#39;s frozen. If you&#39;re fast enough, you can potentially beat him with one use of it, but you still have a large time-frame for hitting him once your meter is fully recharged.</TEXT>
