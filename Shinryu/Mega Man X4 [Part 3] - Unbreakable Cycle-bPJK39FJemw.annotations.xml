  <TEXT>The EX Tank isn&#39;t exactly necessary to get, but since I&#39;m going for every other Heart Tank and Sub-Tank in the game, I may as well pick it up. This item makes it so that whenever you continue your game, you get 4 extra lives instead of 2.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Once again, for anyone who has a better memory of X7 and X8, I feel the need to ask: With the exception of Chill Penguin and maybe Wire Sponge, were there any bosses in the X series easier than Frost Walrus? Not counting the instances where you can get other bosses into kill-cycles with their weaknesses, I honestly can&#39;t think of another Maverick as easy as this guy.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Nearly everyone I know seems to hate this particular stage, and for good reason: It&#39;s basically a combination of twitch reflexes and memorization (especially if you want to get the Heart and Sub-Tanks). Aside from a few specific parts and how finicky the jumping can be at times, I don&#39;t really mind it that much. The stage itself is pretty short, and it has some awesome music as well. Overall, I actually think the concept of these speeder-bike stages has some potential (with that being said however, the first section of Volt Kraken&#39;s stage in X5 can go straight to hell).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Jet Stingray himself can actually prove to be a rather tricky boss at times. When playing as X, the usual strategy is to stick to the opposite wall to him and take out his projectiles with charged shots. If you have his weakness however, it gives you an opportunity to perform one of the game&#39;s easiest and quickest kill cycles (which in turn makes this the one thing Frost Tower is actually useful for).</TEXT>

  <TEXT>The first fight with Colonel isn&#39;t so much difficult as it is incredibly tedious. Even with his weakness (Frost Tower), this fight can still drag on for a while. If you&#39;re playing as Zero, you can skip the first encounter with him altogether. If you&#39;re playing as X and you happen to have the leg upgrade however, this fight can be won by literally staying in one spot.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Frost Tower is downright awful. As in, it&#39;s a strong candidate for one of the worst weapons in the whole X series. Aside from having practically no range (which essentially relies on enemies running into it for it to deal any damage), you can&#39;t quick-switch weapons or attack in any other way once you spawn it. This basically makes you a sitting duck for the roughly 3 or so seconds it stays out, meaning if you&#39;re going to use it, your best bet is to literally get right up in the face of whatever you&#39;re trying to attack - Which in this game, is generally a bad idea against anything not named Jet Stingray. Speaking of which...</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Ground Hunter is probably the best weapon in the game, and even then, that&#39;s not saying much. It functions almost like Search Snake in some ways, except it can&#39;t climb up vertical surfaces and doesn&#39;t have a small arc on initially firing it. You can also make them change directions into a downwards trajectory by hitting down before they hit a surface or enemy. While this doesn&#39;t exactly sound useful at first, it actually proves to be rather efficient in taking down a specific boss even quicker than usual.</TEXT>

  <TEXT>Normally Magma Dragoon would be up next in the weakness chain, but getting the final piece of the Fourth Armor in his stage requires Slash Beast&#39;s weapon. Since this would add to the inevitable backtracking later on, I decided on going a different boss route to prevent it. In any case, I generally like to save Dragoon for last anyways (partly because of his boss fight, and partly because he has one of the worst weapons in the whole game).</TEXT>
